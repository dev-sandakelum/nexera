Sure! Here's a full, comprehensive note about **Static Routing**, covering the concept, types, configuration, pros & cons, and examples. I’ll also include explanations suitable for both beginners and slightly advanced readers.

# **Static Routing**

## **1. Introduction**

Routing is the process of determining the path that data packets take from a source device to a destination device in a network. There are two main types of routing:

* **Static Routing**
* **Dynamic Routing**

**Static Routing** is a type of routing where routes are manually configured and entered into the routing table by a network administrator. These routes do not change unless manually updated.

---

## **2. Key Features of Static Routing**

* **Manual Configuration:** The network administrator must enter the route into the router manually.
* **Fixed Routes:** Routes do not change automatically, even if the network topology changes.
* **Control:** Gives the administrator full control over routing paths.
* **No Protocol Overhead:** Static routing does not require routing protocols like OSPF or RIP.

---

## **3. Advantages of Static Routing**

1. **Simplicity:** Easy to configure for small networks.
2. **Predictability:** Packets always take the same path.
3. **Low Resource Usage:** Does not consume CPU or bandwidth like dynamic routing protocols.
4. **Security:** Less vulnerable to routing attacks since routes are manually defined.

---

## **4. Disadvantages of Static Routing**

1. **Scalability Issues:** Not practical for large networks with frequent topology changes.
2. **Manual Maintenance:** Any change in the network requires manual updates.
3. **No Fault Tolerance:** If a link fails, static routes do not adapt automatically.
4. **Time-Consuming:** Managing many static routes can be tedious.

## **5. Static Routing vs Dynamic Routing**

| Feature        | Static Routing        | Dynamic Routing                 |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Configuration  | Manual                | Automatic via routing protocols |
| Adaptability   | Fixed                 | Can adapt to network changes    |
| Resource Usage | Low                   | Higher (CPU and bandwidth)      |
| Best for       | Small networks        | Large, complex networks         |
| Maintenance    | High (manual updates) | Low (automatic updates)         |

## **6. Types of Static Routes**

1. **Default Route:**
   A route that matches all packets whose destination is unknown in the routing table.

   * **Example:** `0.0.0.0/0` in IPv4 or `::/0` in IPv6
   * Command (Cisco IOS):

     ```
     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop-IP>
     ```

2. **Network Route:**
   Specifies a route to a particular network.

   * Command (Cisco IOS):

     ```
     ip route <destination-network> <subnet-mask> <next-hop-IP>
     ```

3. **Host Route:**
   Route to a single host IP address.

   * Command (Cisco IOS):

     ```
     ip route <host-IP> 255.255.255.255 <next-hop-IP>
     ```

## **7. Configuring Static Routing**

### **7.1 On Cisco Router (CLI Example)**

1. **Access Router CLI:**

   ```
   enable
   configure terminal
   ```

2. **Add Static Route to a Network:**

   ```
   ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   * `192.168.2.0` → Destination network
   * `255.255.255.0` → Subnet mask
   * `192.168.1.2` → Next hop router IP

3. **Add Default Route:**

   ```
   ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1
   ```

4. **Verify Routing Table:**

   ```
   show ip route
   ```

---

## **8. Example Topology**

```
[R1] --- 192.168.1.0/24 --- [R2] --- 192.168.2.0/24 --- [R3]
```

* On **R1**, static route to network `192.168.2.0/24`:

  ```
  ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
  ```

* On **R2**, route to network `192.168.1.0/24`:

  ```
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
  ```

* On **R3**, route to network `192.168.1.0/24` via R2:

  ```
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
  ```

## **9. When to Use Static Routing**

* Small or simple networks with few routers.
* Networks with predictable, stable paths.
* Security-sensitive networks (where control over routing is critical).
* For backup routes alongside dynamic routing (floating static routes).

---

## **10. Floating Static Routes**

A **floating static route** is a static route with a **higher administrative distance** than dynamic routes.

* It is used as a backup route.
* It becomes active only when the primary dynamic route fails.

**Example:**

```
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2 200
```

* `200` → Administrative distance (default static is 1)

---

## **11. Summary**

* **Static Routing:** Manually configured, simple, low-resource routing.
* **Advantages:** Simple, predictable, secure, low overhead.
* **Disadvantages:** Not scalable, no automatic fault tolerance.
* **Best Use:** Small networks, backup routes, security-sensitive networks.
* **Key Commands (Cisco IOS):**

  * `ip route <dest-network> <mask> <next-hop>`
  * `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>` (default route)
  * `show ip route` → view routing table

If you want, I can also make a **visual diagram showing how static routes flow between routers**, which makes it much easier to memorize.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
