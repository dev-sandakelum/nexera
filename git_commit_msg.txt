feat: Implement error handling for data fetching in Notes pages

- Added try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during data fetching in the Notes page, subject page, and note preview page.
- Ensured that empty arrays are returned in case of data retrieval failures, allowing components to manage empty states gracefully.
- Improved user feedback by displaying error messages when data loading fails.
